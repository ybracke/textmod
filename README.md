Text manipulation functionalities

Actually, this can be either pre- or post-precessing so I might rename this
module to `normedit`/`normmanip`/`normprocess` or something like that.

For now (2022-06-24) this is project is a stub with a template file and a test
file. Directory `code2recycle` contains symlinks to previously written programs
that already contain much of the desired functionality.

Important: This module is not supposed to do any reading and writing of data.
This will be done by `~/code/compare-tools/python/prepoc.py`, which is already
quite complete.

# TODOs

- [ ] First step: Write down all of the manipulation I already know this program
is supposed to be able to do.
- [ ] What is the input/output format of this module
- [ ] Get an overview over the code in `code2recycle`



## Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
